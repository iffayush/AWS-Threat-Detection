This was the most frustrating shit I have done in this cloud threat detection lab. The things went south when I setup the kms and s3 bucket policies for their guardduty export respectively. But at the time of configuring the export options when I entrered the bucken arn and kms arn it was always displaying me the unchanged default policy which was eventually failing as Guardduty was facing with a principle service error. typeshit. It was resolved when I switched to CLI and worked my way through and it was straight as an arrow. No bs. No issues everything sat perfectly and it was published to my bucket. Finally. fuck you aws ui console.
