we live another day to fight. after dealing with that lambda new problem arises. not to be explained much but the pain point was that metric filter dont generate their metrics until they are triggered. It might sound very logical and correct but unfortunately this wasn't the case for me a few days ago. I was madly looking for mistakes performing it again and again but no luck. But at last. I figured it out. hehe.
